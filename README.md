# Introduction
- This program's objective is      maintenance of medical records using Python-tkinter and MySQL-Database Management.

- Additionaly, this program offers graphical user interfaces with option to save as .csv (Excel document) file.

## Features

- A six-letter pin to login onto the maintenance page.
- Add, view, edit, and delete records.
- Finding BMI of patients.
- Saving all records in csv file format.

## Requirements
To get along with the challenge you need to have the following:
- Python-3
- MySQL
- Internet
- Python Modules mentioned below
- A code editor (preferably Vs-Code)
- Custom Font (Optional,Mentioned below)

## NOTE

### Default setup
- Make sure you have mysql-connector-python installed and configured.
- The default username and password is set to 'admin'. To change password or the username, make changes in 
- Mysql user and passwd is 'root'and 'tiger' respectively, You might need to change in the main code

## Setup
- I believe you have the motivation, a computer and Internet and a dream. In addition to that basic to intermediate level knowledge in Python and its Modules. If you have those, then you have everything to get started.
or else i am afraid this is just too much for you my friend
